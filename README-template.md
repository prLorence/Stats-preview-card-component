## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

While building this site, it helped me understand flexbox quite a bit, it's a tricky property which made my site off-centered I used margin-top to center it.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

    <div class="description">

      <div class="card-title">

      <h2> Get <span class="violet"> insights </span> that help your business grow. </h2>

      </div>

      <p class="card-subtitle"> Discover the benefits of data analytics and make better decisions regarding revenue, customer 
        experience, and overall efficiency. 
        </p>
    
      <div class="stats-list">
        
        <p>
        <span class="bold"> 10k+ </span> <span class="normal"> companies </span>
        </p>

        <p>
        <span class="bold"> 314 </span> <span class="normal"> templates </span>
        </p>

        <p>
        <span class="bold"> 12m+ </span> <span class="normal"> queries </span>
        </p>
      </div>   

    </div>

```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}

.description {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border-radius: 0 0 5px 5px;
  padding-bottom: 1.5em;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_mix-blend-mode.asp) - This helped me for understanding mix-blend-mode. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
